# crashinfo

### Imagine that you are new Linux user going straight from Windows.  
One of first things you saw was that crashes aren't showed as dialogues.  
Maybe this was strange, but you got used to this in time.  
Anyway, if you want such dialogues, simply use this tool.  
It shows notifications with:

- Type of crash

- Reason of crash

- IP (Instruction pointer) of faulting instruction

- SP (Stack pointer) while the crash

- Position of crash (file in which something has faulted)
